                <p>
                    Working on building an app to help my fraternity moderate events, attendence, duties, financials and other silly things. Doing basic everthing from the dank codes to the sweet sweet colors.

                <p>
                    As part of my time with Mimir as a designer I put together this landing page for their spin-off consultancy firm. Everything you see on that page, from the colors to the particles to the code, is my work. For info on the background animation check out Particle.js below.

                <h3>PlanGrid (technical)</h3>
                <p>
                    For my second internship at PlanGrid I built out deep linking from the web platform into our three native platforms (ios, android, windows). Required a little design and a lot of obj-c, java, c#, and javascript.

                <h3>Mimir (<a href="https://mimirhq.com/">Link</a>)</h3>
                <p>
                    Worked part-time as a designer for a YC startup helping them rework their user flows and user interfaces. Also helped with miscellaneous things such as designing their new office, branding their consultancy branch, Byfrost, and helping with product direction.

                <h3>Particle.js (<a href="http://benalderfer.com/playground/particle/">Demo</a>)</h3>
                <p>
                    I've built several websites with nice particle effects going on (hack the anvil, byfrost, boilermake). I put together this library so that anyone can create simple particle effects on their own with a little bit of configuration.

                <p>
                    Designed a set of music notes for a side project. Unified with consistent weights and a grid. If you ask me I think they look pretty sweet.

                <h3>Titus.js (<a href="http://benalderfer.com/boombox/">Demo</a>)</h3>
                <p>
                    Seriously check out the link, I love this project. Anyways titus is a lightweight js library I wrote that takes live audio and fires events so you can have your web page react to cool beats or even the noise coming through the mic. What are some good use cases you ask? Well I'm not sure, that's why I stopped working on it past it's current state. All the svg work (layout + animation) was done by hand (keyboard).

                <p>
                    Lead the BoilerMake team as the Director. Also attempted to continue leading the design effort and as a result of stretched resources, it turned out pretty poorly IMO (inconsistent branding).

                <h3>Ignite (<a href="http://ignitethefla.me/">Link</a>)</h3>
                <p>
                    I started this program at Purdue as a way to help introduce new freshmen to the community. It pairs them up with an upperclassmen for a semester where they both work on a side project together.

                <h3>PlanGrid (technical)</h3>
                <p>
                    We often use GitHub as an metaphor for Plangrid (e.g. "PlanGrid is GitHub for blueprints"). I worked on implementing the equivalent of forking a repo, what we call Project Cloning. It was very technical yet fun.

                <p>
                    Started a hackathon at Purdue just for first time hackers. Put together a couple of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/designxtech/permalink/761831140576859/">flyers</a> that I liked amongst other material.

                <h3>Vivaldi</h3>
                <p>
                    Built a platform for music educators to interact with their students online. Features include things such as tracking practice, submitting recordings, and gamifying practice habits.

                <p>
                    Redesigned the hackathon from the ground up. New logo, new voice, new imagery. Everything I did laid the ground work to where the organization's design is today.

                    A simple tool that generates a color scheme from an image. Please excuse my adobe edge animations and overall poor code.
