                        THE BEST INTERFACE MIGHT BE NO INTERFACE AT ALL

                        So I've been doing some thinking lately about what has made flat design so popular. After much more thought I came to the conclusion that flat design's success is because it simplifies the design, gets rid of the superficial elements, and creates a more continuous experience. Essential I've come to the conclusion that it minimizes the overall experience for the user. But the one thing I can't get out of my head is that I'm not sure if we as designers are simplifying anything at all. Just because the aesthetics of a product are simple or "flat" doesn't mean the product is any more minimal or easier to use.

                    <p class="dark-blue-type">
                        Ultimately the purpose of an interface is a bridge between the user and the product. As designers it's our responsibility to make sure we're creating the most efficient bridge possible. Instead of trying to make it more beautiful, shouldn't we actually be trying to shorten the length of that bridge to the point where it's non existent? Shouldn't we be trying to design a product that has the most minimal barrier between its users and its functions. Shouldn't we be trying to get rid of the interface all together?

                    <p>Here's the <a class="dark-blue-type italics" href="https://news.layervault.com/stories/27126-the-best-interface-might-be-no-interface-at-all">link</a> to my original post on DN. It led to quite the intriguing discussion but I think most people didn't realize that I'm not talking about what is feasible today. I'm trying to focus on what our goals should be for tommorow.</p>

                        Everyday brilliant people are generating brilliant ideas. Unfortunately, many of these ideas never develop simply because they are missing a crucial element that makes them <span class="bold">stand out from the crowd.</span>
