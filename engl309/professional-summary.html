        Throughout this semester I have been able to extend my knowledge of document design, and how it impacts the reader. When I began the course I was already well versed in most of the tools such as InDesign, Illustrator, and web development.. Although I have a large amount of experience with each of these I had never been formally trained in the best practices of utilizing each tool when crafting a document. Through each project I have learned new techniques and practices when it comes to making design decisions. For example, when aesthetics get in the way of readability your design loses its power in guiding the readers attention.

        In writing my Design Narrative, I had to take a step back and reevaluate my definition of design. Not only did I go online and research what other's consider to be design I kept on looking for the root of design. Why does it exist and why is it so important. Through that analysis I discovered insights I had never even considered before, including how far-reaching design truly is and how it's more than just choosing which colors to use.

        As the semester went on I continued to learn more about the fundamental design principles, iconography, logos, brands, and usability/readability. There wasn't a single topic covered in the class that I don't find valuable in its own right.

        In my major, Computer Science, we are essentially taught how to communicate with computers and make them do what we want. We're taught how to use the computer as a tool and are given a brief introduction to an immense amount of applications. Although I value that education I feel that it lacks depth when it comes to best practices and design thinking. As I move forward in my career I will consider this course to have been imperative when it comes to my ability to create the best digital experiences possible.
