# Projects

This is intended to give you a brief overview of my work. This repo in particular serves as my playground, the place where I can play with code no questions asked. It also serves as my personal archive. You will find a miscellaneous assortment of things, such as a copy of a law firm's [old website](http://balderfer.github.io/hhclaw/), an [email](http://balderfer.github.io/Indiana Bicentennial Email/bicentennial-template.html) I designed for the Indiana Bicentennial Commission, a [scrolling animation](http://balderfer.github.io/boilermake2/) I briefly played with, a proof-of-concept [landing page](http://balderfer.github.io/demo/), the [first iteration of a website](http://balderfer.github.io/csmoves/1/) for Purdue's CS Department, the [second iteration of a website](http://balderfer.github.io/csmoves/2/) for Purdue's CS Department, my [résumé](http://balderfer.github.io/resume/, an [old unfinished portfolio](http://balderfer.github.io/website%20as%20of%201:28:2015/), another [unfinished attempt](http://balderfer.github.io/portfolio/) to redesign my portfolio, and the [very first website I ever made](http://balderfer.github.io/retro/).
