Meeting Megan Smith, U.S. CTO, was the  
most significant of my experiences at  
Grace Hopper, but definitely not the only  
one.   
  
During the opening keynote, I sat beside  
and met Barbara Birungi, founder of  
Women in Technology Uganda, as she was  
there to receive the GHC ABI award.  
  
Grace Hopper allows students like myself  
who are aspiring to be pioneers and make  
a difference an opportunity to not only see  
and honor but meet those women who  
are where we aspire to be.

It is important that young women get to  
go to Grace Hopper because there really  
aren't many times in Computer Science  
where you feel like a part of a  
community. Since it is such a male  
dominated field often times you can feel  
secluded or like only men can do well.  
Grace Hopper helps show that you are  
not alone and there are thousands of  
women like you out there that can make  
a difference and be a real standout in  
their field.

The biggest benefit for me, besides gaining experience with  
recruiters, was becoming more excited about CS.  
   
Talking to recruiters made me want to pursue more  
personal projects so that I will have more experience and  
after the conference, I was more excited to code and create  
stuff.   
  
After seeing all the different fields and applications of CS, I  
want to experiment with many of them to find out which  
field I want to pursue.
